# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## ✅ Good News!

Your repository is **READY** for GitHub Pages! The browser should have opened to your repository settings.

## 📋 Follow These Simple Steps:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (In the browser that just opened)

You should see the "Pages" settings page at:
`https://github.com/Pritamx4/valentine/settings/pages`

If not, follow these steps manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/Pritamx4/valentine
2. Click **Settings** (top right of the repository)
3. Scroll down and click **Pages** (in the left sidebar)

### Step 2: Configure the Source

On the Pages settings page:

1. Under **Build and deployment** section
2. Under **Source**, select: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Under **Branch**, select:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment (1-2 minutes)

GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site. You'll see:
- A message saying "Your site is being built"
- Then it will change to "Your site is live at..."

### Step 4: Access Your Live Site! 🎉

After deployment (usually 1-2 minutes), your Valentine's proposal will be live at:

**🔗 https://pritamx4.github.io/valentine/**

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

   - Or any messaging app!

3. **Add a message like:**
   - "I made something special for you... 💕"

## 🔄 Need to Make Changes?

If you want to update anything:

   - Click the heart 5 times
   - Try clicking "No" button 😏

1. Check the Actions tab: https://github.com/Pritamx4/valentine/actions
2. Make sure the deployment workflow completed successfully
3. Try refreshing the page

2. Verify the branch is set to `main` and folder is `/ (root)`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for the first deployment

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Once GitHub Pages is enabled:
- Your site will be live
- Every push to `main` updates it automatically
- No server costs - it's FREE forever!
